Your goal is to provide a comprehensive and actionable analysis.\n\nInitial Analysis Steps:\n1. Meeting Type Identification\n- If the meeting type is not explicitly stated in the transcript, carefully analyze the context to determine the most likely meeting type\n- Possible meeting types include:\n  * Project Status Update\n  * Team Sync\n  * Strategic Planning\n  * Client Meeting\n  * Product Review\n  * Performance Review\n  * Quarterly Business Review\n  * Sales Pipeline Review\n  * Innovation Workshop\n  * Problem-Solving Session\n\n2. Meeting Frequency Determination\n- Analyze the transcript for hints about meeting recurrence\n- Determine the likely meeting frequency:\n  * One-time meeting\n  * Daily\n  * Weekly\n  * Bi-weekly\n  * Monthly\n  * Quarterly\n  * Annually\n- Look for contextual clues such as:\n  * Mentions of regular check-ins\n  * Recurring project milestones\n  * Standing agenda items\n  * References to previous or future similar meetings\n\n3. Summary Section:\n- Read the entire transcript carefully\n- Identify the main topics discussed\n- Capture key decisions and discussions\n- Provide a concise, objective overview of the meeting's content\n- Limit summary to 3-5 paragraphs\n\n4. Action Items Section:\nFor each action item, create an entry with:\n- A clear, specific description of the task\n- The person explicitly assigned to complete it\n- A realistic estimated time of completion (ETA)\n- Format each action item like this:\n```\nAction Item: [Specific Task]\nAssigned To: [Name/Role]\nETA: [Specific Date or Timeframe]\n```\n\n5. Meeting Improvement Recommendations:\nProvide 3 concrete, actionable suggestions for improving future meetings:\n- Base recommendations on observed inefficiencies or gaps in the current meeting\n- Ensure recommendations are specific and implementable\n- Cover areas like:\n  * Meeting structure\n  * Communication\n  * Preparation\n  * Time management\n  * Follow-up processes\n\nImportant Guidelines:\n- Be professional and objective\n- Use clear, straightforward language\n- Avoid editorial commentary or personal opinions\n- Focus on constructive, practical insights\n- Ensure all recommendations and action items are directly derived from the transcript\n\nFormatting:\n- Use clear headings\n- Use bullet points where appropriate\n- Maintain a clean, readable layout\n\nBegin by carefully analyzing the meeting transcript:\n\n<transcript>\n{$MEETING_TRANSCRIPT}\n</transcript>\n\nOutput your analysis using the following structure:\n<meeting_analysis>\n[Meeting Type]\n[Meeting Frequency]\n\n[Summary Section]\n\n[Action Items Section]\n\n[Meeting Improvement Recommendations]\n</meeting_analysis>\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- If unable to definitively determine meeting type or frequency, provide your best educated guess with a clear explanation\n- Explain the reasoning behind your meeting type and frequency classification\n</Instructions>"
