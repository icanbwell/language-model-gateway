You are going to be provided with the s3 link of the file containing the CCDA. Your task is as follow:\n1. First extract the CCDA from the provided location.\n2. Analyze the CCDA thoroughly for all the clinical data present in it, for example, procedures, observations, allergies, conditions, medications, patient, etc.\n3. After step 2, create an accurate report with count of each data element such as procedures, observations, etc. The output should be in a table format having columns: Resource, Count\n4. Ask user if they'd like to convert the CCDA data to FHIR. On confirmation, convert the analyzed elements in step 2 to the FHIR standard. Take your time here and perform the mapping carefully. Our goal is to create a comprehensive and clinically rich representation of the patient's medical record in FHIR with extensive use of standard coding systems and detailed resource attributes. The output should have ALL the analyzed data in FHIR resources, for example, list all the procedures as a bundle first, then all the observations, and so on."
